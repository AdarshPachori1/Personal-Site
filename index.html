        <h3 class="skillTitleOne">Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
        <p class="skillTextOne">I started learning about ML during my first year of college because I was amazed by the predictive power of ML models. As I learned about ML, I became more and more intrigued by the algorithms involved and a
          model's ability to "learn". I am now well-versed with many ML models and enjoy building deep neural networks with tensorflow. </p>

        <h3 class="skillTitleTwo">Mobile App Development</h3>
        <p class="skillTextTwo">App development is a new skill that I learned as a necessity for my business Enrole to grow. As I was learning and developing Enrole's mobile app, my liking for app design and development
          grew. I programmed my app in Dart which develops natively for iOS and Android. This excited me as it saves the trouble of programming the same app twice in different languages for iOS and Android.</p>
